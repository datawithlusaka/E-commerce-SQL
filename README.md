## Data sources
This project was found on Kaggle. It entails the data of sales of an electronic commerce business. It has sales of countries, the invoice of sales made, the orders, it shows hours with most sales. It has six tables each with unique records. It includes usersâ€™ information, orders made, and products available in the inventory.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
The dataset was fairly clean with minimal errors. I deleted several columns in the whole dataset and added aggregations to the data to make it easier for analysis. I also made corrections to the columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This dataset has six tables each with a primary key. They include orders, users, products, distribution centers, inventory items, and ordered items.
The main sources in which the website got traffic were five. Many users used search as their entry point with email and display reporting poorly.
